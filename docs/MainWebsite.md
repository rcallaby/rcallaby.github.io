# Main Website Markdown File

This website is primarily inspired by Traversy Media and it was written following the very detailed youtube tutorial that outlined how to write all of this code.

The reason I am keeping this in my personal repository is that this is a great example of an open source website design that could be modified easily to fit different customer's needs, or my needs for that matter.

However, I can't take full credit for this webstie, obviously, as this was the result of following a youtube tutorial. I suggest you look up Traversy Media channel on youtube to see what else he has going on, its a great channel and it is worth your time to check it out.
